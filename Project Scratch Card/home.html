        <p id="welcome" class="text-xl text-center ml-10 mr-10 mt-5">
            Beginning on the 1st December 2023 I am delighted to say I am going to take on the challenge of buying a scratch card every day for a whole year. 
            I have decided to record this process on this website, updating it every Thursday. <br> I will provide a photograph of each scratch card purchased, then, 
            at the end of the week, produce a video of the results. This video will also be uploaded to this site. </p>
        <p id="motivation" class="text-xl text-center ml-10 mr-10 mt-5"> 
            The motivation to undertake this project forms from the desire that I want to purchase something daily.
            The need for a newspaper to start the day is old fashioned with news being available 24/7. 
            <br> My aim is to go to a shop each day at the same time, bringing much needed routine to my life and, with it, the idea of winning big. </p>    
        <p id="rules" class="text-xl text-center ml-10 mr-10 my-5">
                There are three rules which must be followed</p>  <!-- p = paragraph there are three here to aid formatting-->
           

        <ol id="list" class="list-decimal text-lg italic">  <!--or = Ordered list it should display 1. 2. 3. below but it doesn't - maybe due to tailwind overriding it???-->
            <li>Only one scratch card can be brought each day*</li>
            <li>£15 must be spent every week, no more, no less**</li>
            <li>No other gambling is to be undertaken throughout the year***</li>
